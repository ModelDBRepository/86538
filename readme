This is the readme file for the model "Model of calcium oscillations
in olfactory cilia (Reidl et al. 2006)", which is the matlab program
Ca_dyn_ORN_Reidl_etal.m.

To run the matlab program, download it and start matlab. Within
matlab, change to the directory that contains the program. Type at the
matlab prompt

Ca_dyn_ORN_Reidl_etal(q)

with q= 2,3 or 4 (see the comments in the program code for the
meaning).
